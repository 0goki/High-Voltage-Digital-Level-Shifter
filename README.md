# High Voltage Digital Level Shifter

![IMG_5034](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bfabe3d-b57f-4cef-a40a-acb8066a557a)

An ESP32-based microcontroller with an opto-isolated level shifter designed to take up to 3 separate 5V TTL signals and output up to 12 channels of digital signals at 5-24V without signal inversion. The 12-channel output is also configured with flyback diodes and an isolated ground, serving as a solenoid driver supporting 12 solenoids with a total power draw of 24V at 5A.

Designed for Aerotech gantry systems running Automation1 and wired for Position Synchronized Output (PSO).
